## Laravel Ecommerce Project


### The goal for this is to develop a base code for ecommerce with:
* shopping cart
* account information
* order/customer tracking
* analytics
* SSL/TLS/Certificates for https
* payment processing
* drop shipping
* SEO
* openshift or other cloud hosting
* full stack documentation
* database ER diagram
* tests
* skinning of front end


### Philosophical goals
* There's probably a bunch of these ecommerce options out there, however I want to remain with the Laravel spirit of simplicity and delight to use/extend.
* I want to keep it easy, cleanly coded, and documented enough for beginners to use happily, while leaving it extensible enough for an experienced dev to fork.
